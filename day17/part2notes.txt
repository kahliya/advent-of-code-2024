Target: 2,4,1,3,7,5,4,2,0,3,1,5,5,5,3,0
Work backwards

==== 3,0
Loop until A is 0

==== 5,5 (out, B)
Output B

==== 1, 5 (bxl, 5)
B = B ^ 0101
>> 0000 = 0101 ^ 0101
>> B needs to be 5 here

==== 0, 3 (adv, 3)
A = A / 2^3 = A / 8
>> 0 = 0 / 8
>> A needs to be 0 here

==== 4, 2 (bxc, ignore)
B = B ^ C
>> 0101 = 0101 ^ 0000

==== 7, 5 (cdv, B)
C = A / 2^B
>> 0 = 0 / 2^5

==== 1, 3 (bxl, 3)
B = B ^ 0011
>> 0101 = 0110 ^ 0011

==== 2, 4 (bst, A)
B = A % 8
>> 0110 = 6
6 = A % 8
>> A = 6
